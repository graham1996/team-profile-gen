# team-profile-gen

## Team Profile Generator
## Description
This project uses the command line to input information about a team of employees, and return that information as an HTML page. 
To use, make sure all neccessary dependencies are installed, and then run "node index.js" in the terminal to start the program.
You'll be met with a simple menu asking which type of employee you would like to add, start with your team manager and go from there!

## Bugs
Currently, while functional, there are a few minor issues with this app. When creating your team, you may notice that if you only have one employee, there are some CSS issues in regards to the HTML display.
Once more employees are added this should disappear, but I will be fixing this issue soon. Thank you for your patience!
